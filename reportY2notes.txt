2) We are focusing on the structures that allow for these calculations
(mathematician's approach). However, it is not a far leap from the
analysis done in 2,6 paper to getting to the types of numerical
results found in Amplituhedron squared.

3) Here we talk about a section of the line bundle over Gr+(k,n)
defined by the the Wilson loop diagrams. These are 3k
dimentional. Non-orientability paper shows that these are actually 4k
dimensional spaces. The connection 4k dimensional cells of the
Amplituhedron is still aspirational (e.g. Amplituhedron squared and
Heslop-Stewart, possilby domino-basis paper?)

1 & 4) We do not have a connection to Plabic graphs. Infact, I suspect
that what we are looking at are different from the cells defined by
plabic graphs. We may be able to mention the plabic graph literature
in the intro, and leave it at that.

4) Ask Cameron might know more about what this parametrization by
boundary measurement thing is?  Cameron: Something in big Postnikov
paper. "WLD almost do this, aside from a set of measure 0."

1) question for another day.

Cameron's take on 1 & 4:
1) square moves on plabic graphs are a
reparametrization of the positroid cell. We have a reparametrization
as well: the exact subdiagrams. However, these are likely not the same
changes of coordinates, nor do they correspond to the smae objects

4) The boundary measure map is puts weights on vertices of of a plabic
graph and uses it to compute plucker coordinates. In our case, we go
from WLDs to matrices. Just plug in and compute the coordinates. In fact, 
the WLDs ARE a parametrization.
